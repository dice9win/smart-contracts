 * The library provides abstractions to manage contract's bets storage in a code-friendly way.
 *
 * The main idea behind the routines is to abuse the fact that a single PackedBet occupies 32 bytes, meaining
 * that the contract can store 8 of those in a single storage slot. Squeezing multiple bets into a single slots
 * allows to save on gas tremendeously and requires just a handful of helper routines to make it transparent to the
 * outer contract.
 *
 * The library exports a struct called Bets that is designed to keep track of players' bets – an instance of this structre,
 * along with "storage" modifier, is required to invoke libraries' functions.
