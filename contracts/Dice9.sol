 * Summary
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Inspired by many projects in the Ethereum ecosystem, this smart contract implements a set of robust, provably fair games of chance.
 * The users can play one of four available games, wagering cryptocurrency at the odds they choose and even take part in Jackpot rolls!
 *
 * Coin Flip
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This game allows to choose a side of the coin – heads or tails – and bet on it. Once the bet settles, the winning amount is paid if the
 * side matches the one chosen by the player.
 *
 * Dice
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This game allows to choose 1 to 5 numbers of a dice cube and wins if a dice roll ends up with one of those numbers. The more numbers
 * are chosen the higher is the chance of winning, but the multiplier is less.
 *
 * Two Dice
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This game allows to choose 1 to 11 numbers representing the sum of two dice. Similar to Dice game, if two dice add up to one of the
 * numbers chosen, the winnings are paid back.
 *
 * Etheroll
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This game allows to place a bet on a number in 3 to 97 range, and if the random number produced (from 1..100 range) is less or equal
 * than the chosen one, the bet is considered a win.
 *
 * Winnings
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * If a bet wins, all the funds (including Jackpot payment, if it was eligible and won the Jackpot) are paid back to the address which
 * made the bet. Due to legal aspects, we do not distribute the winnings to other address(es), other currencies and so on.
 *
 * Jackpots
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * If a bet exceeds a certain amount (the UI will display that), a tiny Jackpot fee is taken on top of default House commission and the
 * bet automatically plays for Jackpot. Jackpots are events that have 0.1% chance of happening, but if they do, the bet gets an extra
 * portion of the winnings determined by Jackpot logic. The Jackpot rolls are completely independent from the games themselves, meaning
 * if a bet that lost a game can still get a Jackpot win.
 *
 * Commisions
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * In order to maintain the game, which includes paying for bet resolution transactions, servers for the website, our support engineers
 * and developers, the smart contract takes a fee from every bet. The specific amounts can be seen below in the constants named
 * HOUSE_EDGE_PERCENT, HOUSE_EDGE_MINIMUM_AMOUNT and JACKPOT_FEE.
 *
 * Questions?

 * Please feel free to refer to our website at https://dice9.win for instructions on how to play, support channel, legal documents
 * and other helpful things.

   * The function performs a few boring, but very important checks:
   *  1. It makes sure that all the bets currently accepted will be payable, even if all of them win (since we do not know upfront).
   *     If the contract sees that the potential winnings from pending bets exceed contract's balance, it would refrain from accepting the bet.

   *     situations when a single whale drains the contract in one lucky bet and everyone else has to wait until the House tops the contract up.
   *     Please mind this value is kept reasonably high so you should rarely run into such a limitation.
   *  3. It makes sure the player does not place "non-sensial" bets, like all Dice numbers or no sides in CoinFlip.
   *

   * It is expected that a Croupier (i.e. our software having access to the secret encryption key) would invoke this function,
   * passing some number of ecnrypted bets. The RSA VRF utilities (see VRF.sol) would validate the authenticity of the ecrypted data
   * received (e.g. check that the bets are encrypted with the specific secret key).
   *
   * If the authencity is confirmed, the routine would use the encrypted text as the source of entropy – essentially, treat
   * the encrypted bet data as a huge number. Since the contract uses pretty strong and battle-tested encryption (RSA 1024 bits), this
   * number is guaranteed to be unpredictable and uniformely distributed. The only party which can produce this number is, of course,
   * the Croupier – the possession of the secret key is required to calculate the number. The Croupier, in its turn, cannot tamper
   * with the bet attributes (since the contract keeps track of what players bet on) and has to create a number for every bet submitted.
   * Since the key is fixed, every bet attributes get a single, unique number from the croupier.

   * A publicly available function used to request a refund on a bet if it was not processed.
   *
   * The player or the House can refund any unprocessed bet during every other 8-hour window following
   * the bet.
   *
   * The logic of the time constraint is as follows:
   *  1. The day is split into 4 hour windows, i.e. 00:00-08:00, 08:00-16:00, 16:00-24:00 etc
   *  2. The smart contract keeps track of the window number the bet was placed in. For example, if
   *     the bet is placed at 02:15, it will be attributed to 00:00-08:00 window.
   *  3. The player can request the refund during every other 8-hour window following the bet.
   *     For example, if the bet is placed at 02:15, one can refund it during 16:00-20:00, or
   *     during 04:00-12:00 (next day), but not at 12:00 the same day.
   *
   * The refund window logic is a bit convoluted, but it is kept this way to minimise the gas requirements
   * imposed on all the bets going through the system. It is in House's best interests to make sure
   * this function is never needed – if all the bets are processed in a timely manner, noone would ever
   * invoke this. We decided to keep this in, however, to assure the players the funds will never end up
   * locked up in the contract, even if the Croupier stops revealing all the bets forever.
