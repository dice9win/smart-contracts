/**
 * The library providing RSA-based Verifiable Random Function utilities.
 *
 * The main workhorse of our VRF generation is decrypt() function. Being given RSA modulus chunks and the memory slice
 * of 256 bytes containing encrypted VRF, it attemps to decrypt the data and expand it into a tuple of bet properties.
 *
 * The calling contract can then validate that the bet described by the returned tuple is active and proceed with settling it.
 *
 * The random number source is the hash of encrypted data chunk. The players cannot predict that value since they do not know
 * the secret key corresponding to the RSA modulus hardcoded in the contract; the house cannot tamper with player's bets since
 * the VRF value that passes all the checks is unique due to RSA being a permutation (see Dice9.sol for the proof).
 *
 * The distribution is uniform due to RSA ciphertext being hashed.
 *
 * The above properties allow Dice9 to perform robust and verifiable random number generation using a seed value consisting of bet
 * information such as player address, bet amount, bet options and bet nonce.
